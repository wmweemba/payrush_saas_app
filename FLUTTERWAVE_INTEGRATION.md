# Flutterwave Payment Integration - Setup Guide

## Overview
PayRush now includes complete Flutterwave payment integration, enabling secure invoice payments with automatic status updates. This guide covers the setup and usage of the new payment system.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### Payment Processing
- **Pay Now Buttons**: Available on Pending, Sent, and Overdue invoices
- **Flutterwave Checkout Modal**: Secure payment interface with multiple payment methods
- **Real-time Verification**: Automatic transaction verification and invoice updates
- **Payment Records**: Complete transaction tracking in dedicated database table

### Supported Payment Methods
- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Verve, etc.)
- Mobile Money (MTN, Airtel, Vodafone, etc.)
- Bank Transfers
- USSD Payments

### Security Features
- Webhook signature verification
- Transaction amount validation
- Duplicate payment prevention
- Secure API key management

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Flutterwave Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLW_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK_TEST-your-public-key-here
FLW_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST-your-secret-key-here

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important**: Replace placeholder keys with your actual Flutterwave API keys:
- Get your keys from [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/dashboard)
- Use TEST keys for development
- Use LIVE keys only for production

### 2. Database Migration
Run the payments table migration to create the payment records table:

```sql
-- The migration file is located at:
-- supabase/migrations/003_create_payments_table.sql

-- This creates:
-- - payments table with comprehensive schema
-- - RLS policies for data security
-- - Indexes for performance
-- - Foreign key relationships with invoices
```

### 3. Supabase Setup
Ensure your Supabase project has:
- The invoices table (from previous migrations)
- The new payments table (from migration 003)
- Proper RLS policies enabled
- API keys configured in environment variables

## üì± User Flow

### For Invoice Creators (Business Owners)
1. Create invoices through the dashboard
2. Share invoice details with customers
3. Customers can click "Pay Now" button
4. Payment is processed through Flutterwave
5. Invoice automatically updates to "Paid" status
6. Payment record is created for tracking

### For Customers (Invoice Recipients)
1. Receive invoice information
2. Click "Pay Now" button on invoice
3. Choose payment method in Flutterwave modal
4. Complete payment securely
5. Receive confirmation of successful payment

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `client/src/lib/payments/flutterwave.js` - Payment utilities and integration
- `client/src/app/api/payments/verify/route.js` - Payment verification endpoint
- `supabase/migrations/003_create_payments_table.sql` - Database migration

#### Modified Files
- `client/src/app/dashboard/page.js` - Added Pay Now buttons and payment processing
- `client/.env.local` - Added Flutterwave environment variables
- Existing webhook handler updated for processWebhook function

### Database Schema

#### payments table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- invoice_id (UUID, Foreign Key to invoices)
- amount (DECIMAL)
- currency (VARCHAR)
- status (VARCHAR) - pending, successful, failed, cancelled
- reference (VARCHAR, Unique) - Payment reference
- flutterwave_id (VARCHAR) - Flutterwave transaction ID
- payment_method (VARCHAR) - Payment method used
- customer_email (VARCHAR)
- customer_name (VARCHAR)
- created_at/updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### API Endpoints

#### POST /api/payments/verify
- Verifies Flutterwave transactions
- Updates invoice status to "Paid"
- Creates payment record
- Returns verification result

#### POST /api/webhooks/flutterwave
- Handles webhook notifications
- Processes payment status updates
- Maintains data consistency

## üß™ Testing

### Test Payment Flow
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a test invoice with status "Pending"
3. Click "Pay Now" button
4. Use Flutterwave test cards for testing:
   - Test Card: 4242424242424242
   - CVV: 123
   - Expiry: Any future date

### Test Webhook (Optional)
- Use tools like ngrok to expose local development
- Configure webhook URL in Flutterwave dashboard
- Test payment completion flows

## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Replace TEST API keys with LIVE keys
- [ ] Enable webhook signature verification
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints
- [ ] Monitor transaction logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys

### Best Practices
- Never expose secret keys in client-side code
- Validate all payment amounts server-side
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Enable Flutterwave transaction monitoring

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in the client directory
   - Restart development server after changes
   - Check variable names match exactly

2. **Payment Modal Not Opening**
   - Verify Flutterwave public key is correct
   - Check browser console for script loading errors
   - Ensure network connectivity

3. **Payment Verification Failing**
   - Check Flutterwave secret key is correct
   - Verify invoice exists in database
   - Check payment amount matches invoice amount

4. **Webhook Not Working**
   - Ensure webhook URL is accessible
   - Verify webhook signature (when implemented)
   - Check server logs for errors
