  - **Problem**: Bulk status update to "Cancelled" was failing and incorrectly showing invoices as "draft" status
  - **Error Details**: Database constraint violation error: `new row for relation "invoices" violates check constraint "invoices_status_check"`
  - **Root Cause**: Database constraint did not include 'cancelled' as a valid status value, only allowing: `'draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue'`
  - **Historical Context**: From changelog v1.9.10 - previous workaround mapped cancelled to 'draft' with approval_status tracking
  - **Complete Solution**: Updated database constraint to properly support cancelled status
    - **Database Migration**: Created migration `017_fix_status_constraint_add_cancelled.sql`
    - **Updated Constraint**: Now allows: `'draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue', 'cancelled'`

## [1.9.17] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
#### Search Functionality - Resolved Text Search Error with Line Items

- **üîß Fixed Search Query Error When Searching Invoices**
  - **Problem**: Text search functionality failed with error "failed to parse logic tree" when searching for invoice content
  - **Error Details**: `customer_name.ilike.%Desktop%,customer_email.ilike.%Desktop%,invoice_items.description.ilike.%Desktop%` could not be parsed by Supabase

### Fixed
#### Analytics Dashboard - Corrected Overdue Invoice Count

- **üîß Fixed Overdue Count Discrepancy in Analytics Dashboard**
  - **Problem**: Analytics dashboard showed 0 overdue invoices when status breakdown clearly showed overdue invoices existed
  - **Root Cause**: Backend overdue calculation only counted invoices past due date, but didn't include invoices explicitly marked with "Overdue" status
  - **Impact**: Users couldn't trust the analytics data for business decision making
  - **Solution**: Enhanced overdue calculation to include both scenarios
    - **Explicit Overdue Status**: Now counts invoices with status = "Overdue" 
    - **Past Due Date Logic**: Continues to count unpaid invoices past their due date
    - **Case Sensitivity**: Improved handling of different status case formats
    - **Paid Rate Accuracy**: Fixed paid rate calculation to handle both "Paid" and "paid" status formats

### Fixed
#### PDF Generation - Line Items Display & Layout Issues

- **üîß Fixed Line Items Not Displaying in PDF**
  - **Problem**: Generated PDFs showed only a single "Invoice Payment" item instead of actual invoice line items
  - **Root Cause**: PDF generation was not fetching related `invoice_items` data from the database
  - **Solution**: Enhanced both individual and bulk PDF generation to properly fetch and display line items
    - **Individual PDF Downloads**: Now fetches invoice with related `invoice_items` using Supabase join query

### Fixed
#### Bulk PDF Export - Proper PDF Generation Implementation

- **üîß Bulk PDF Export Now Generates Actual PDFs**
  - **Problem**: Bulk PDF export was generating HTML files instead of actual PDF files like individual invoice downloads
  - **User Request**: Change bulk PDF export to work like the individual PDF export buttons that correctly generate downloadable PDF files
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Individual PDF downloads use client-side `downloadInvoicePDF()` function with jsPDF library
    - Bulk PDF export was using server-side HTML generation approach
    - Users expected consistent PDF generation behavior across both individual and bulk operations
  - **Solution**: Unified PDF generation approach for both individual and bulk exports
    - **Individual PDF Downloads**: Continue using existing `downloadInvoicePDF(invoice, profile, templateId)` 
    - **Bulk PDF Downloads**: Now use same `downloadInvoicePDF()` function for each selected invoice

## [1.9.12] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
#### Bulk PDF Export JSON Parsing Error Resolution

- **üîß Critical API Client Content Type Handling**
  - **Problem**: Bulk PDF export failing with "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON" error
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Server correctly returns HTML content for PDF export with `text/html` MIME type
    - Frontend `apiClient` function was attempting to parse all successful responses as JSON
    - PDF export returns HTML content that can be printed to PDF, not JSON data
  - **Solution**: Enhanced `apiClient` to handle multiple content types based on server response headers

- **üîß PDF Export Database Table Name Error**
  - **Problem**: PDF export was failing with database error "Could not find the table 'public.invoice_line_items' in the schema cache"
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Code was querying `invoice_line_items` table that doesn't exist
    - Actual database table is named `invoice_items` (created in migration 010)
    - PostgreSQL error code PGRST205: table not found
  - **Solution**: Updated query to use correct table name `invoice_items`
  - **Files Changed**: `server/services/bulkInvoiceService.js`

- **üîß PDF Export Placeholder Blocking Functionality**
  - **Problem**: PDF export was blocked by placeholder message "PDF bulk export feature coming soon. Use CSV or Excel for now."
  - **Root Cause**: `BulkExportService.generatePDFExport()` had placeholder implementation that always returned error

## [1.9.10] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
#### Bulk Invoice Status Update & Database Constraint Issues

- **üîß Bulk Status Update Constraint Violations**
  - **Problem**: Bulk status updates were failing with database constraint violation errors
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Multiple status-related columns (`status` and `approval_status`) with inconsistent values
    - Database constraint `invoices_status_check` expected lowercase values instead of capitalized ones
    - Migration 001 intended to use capitalized values but was never properly applied
    - Migration 012 approval workflow trigger was setting incompatible status combinations
  - **Error Details**: 
    - PostgreSQL error code 23514: "new row for relation 'invoices' violates check constraint 'invoices_status_check'"
    - Failing on attempts to set `status = 'Sent'` with `approval_status = 'draft'`
    - Status 'cancelled' was not allowed by the original constraint
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated bulk service to use lowercase status values that match actual database constraint
    - Added mapping for both `status` and `approval_status` columns to maintain consistency
    - Implemented workaround for 'cancelled' status by mapping to 'draft' with approval_status tracking
    - Added individual invoice processing to isolate failures and provide better error reporting
  - **Status Mapping**: 
    - `pending` ‚Üí `status: 'draft'`, `approval_status: 'draft'`
    - `sent` ‚Üí `status: 'sent'`, `approval_status: 'draft'`
    - `paid` ‚Üí `status: 'paid'`, `approval_status: 'draft'`
    - `cancelled` ‚Üí `status: 'draft'`, `approval_status: 'cancelled'`
  - **Files Changed**: 
    - `server/services/bulkInvoiceService.js` - Updated status mapping and processing logic
    - Created `supabase/migrations/016_fix_approval_workflow_trigger.sql` for future trigger fix

#### Invoice Filtering Clear All Button

- **üîß Clear All Button Permanently Disabled**
  - **Problem**: "Clear All" button remained greyed out even when filters were active
  - **Root Cause**: `getActiveFilterCount()` function wasn't counting active quick filters
  - **Solution**: Updated function to include `activeQuickFilter` in filter count calculation
  - **User Impact**: Clear All button now properly enables when any filters are applied
  - **Files Changed**: `client/src/components/invoices/InvoiceSearchInterface.js`

#### Analytics Dashboard Paid Rate Calculation

- **üîß Paid Rate Showing 0.0% Despite Paid Invoices**
  - **Problem**: Analytics dashboard showed "Paid Rate: 0.0%" even when invoices were marked as paid
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Frontend was looking for `stats.byStatus?.Paid` (capitalized)
    - Backend was returning `stats.byStatus.paid` (lowercase) from actual database values
    - Status display mapping was inconsistent between frontend and backend
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated Paid Rate calculation to use lowercase `stats.byStatus?.paid`
    - Added `getStatusDisplay()` function to convert database values to proper display format
    - Updated `getStatusColor()` to handle both lowercase and capitalized status values
    - Maintained proper capitalization for UI display while using correct database values for calculations
  - **User Impact**: Paid Rate now correctly shows "33.3%" when 1 of 3 invoices is paid
  - **Files Changed**: `client/src/components/invoices/InvoiceSearchStats.js`

### Technical Notes
- **Database Status Values**: Confirmed database constraint expects lowercase values (`'draft'`, `'sent'`, `'paid'`, `'overdue'`)
- **Migration 001**: Intended to update constraint to capitalized values but was never properly applied
- **Dual Status System**: System uses both `status` (main invoice status) and `approval_status` (workflow tracking)
- **Future Work**: Need to apply migration 016 to fix approval workflow trigger properly

## [1.9.9] - 2025-10-28

### Added
#### Simple Invoice Description Field

- **üìù Description Field for Simple Invoices**
  - **Feature**: Added description/service name input field to Simple Invoice form
  - **User Need**: Users needed to describe what they're billing for on simple invoices
  - **Previous State**: Simple invoice only had amount field - no way to specify what the charge was for
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added description text input field above the amount field
    - Required field with placeholder examples: "Website Design Services, Consulting Fee, Monthly Retainer"
    - Description automatically creates a single line item when invoice is created
    - Validation ensures description is not empty before invoice creation
  - **User Impact**: Users can now provide clear descriptions for simple invoice charges

### Fixed
#### Public Invoice View - Database Query Error

- **üîß Invoice Not Found Error on Public Invoice Pages**
  - **Problem**: Clicking "View Invoice" button resulted in "Invoice Not Found" error
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - SQL query was selecting `notes` column which doesn't exist in the invoices table
    - PostgreSQL error code 42703: "column invoices.notes does not exist"
    - Initial fix attempted to resolve join issues, but actual problem was simpler
  - **Error Details**: 
    - Console error: "Invoice not found" at `loadInvoice` function
    - HTTP 404 response from `/api/public/invoice/:id` endpoint
    - Server logs showed: `column invoices.notes does not exist`
  - **Debugging Process**:
    - Added comprehensive logging to API endpoint to trace exact Supabase errors
    - Logged invoice ID, query execution, error codes, and response preparation
    - Identified specific column name causing PostgreSQL error
  - **Solution**:
    - Removed `notes` column from SELECT query in public invoice endpoint
    - Removed `notes` field from response object
    - Query now only selects columns that exist in the database schema
  - **Technical Changes**:
    - Removed `notes` from invoice query SELECT statement
    - Removed `notes: invoice.notes` from publicInvoice response object
    - Added detailed console logging for future debugging (can be removed later)
    - Query now successfully retrieves invoices without schema errors
  - **Result**: 
    - Public invoice pages now load successfully
    - No more 404 errors when viewing invoices
    - Invoice details display correctly with line items
    - Business information displays from profile data

### Improved
#### Invoice Type Selector Visual Enhancement

- **üé® Enhanced Invoice Type Toggle Design**
  - **Problem**: Users couldn't easily tell which invoice type was selected (Simple vs Detailed)
  - **Previous State**: Subtle tab indicator made selection unclear
  - **Solution**:
    - **Bolder TabsList Background**: Changed from subtle to prominent gray background (`bg-gray-100 dark:bg-slate-800`)
    - **Active Tab Colors**: 
      - Simple Invoice: Bright blue background (`bg-blue-600`) with white text when selected
      - Detailed Line Items: Bright purple background (`bg-purple-600`) with white text when selected
    - **Shadow Effect**: Added shadow to active tab for depth and emphasis
    - **Smooth Transitions**: Added transition animations for professional feel
    - **Enhanced Info Cards**: Increased border width to 2px with stronger border colors
    - **Icon Enhancement**: Made header icons larger (w-5 h-5) and added to section titles
  - **Result**: 
    - Selected invoice type is immediately obvious
    - Clear visual distinction between Simple and Detailed modes
    - Better color coordination with section info cards (blue for simple, purple for detailed)
    - Professional, polished appearance

## [1.9.8] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
#### Detailed Invoice Line Items Entry - Critical UX Fix

- **üìù Line Items Entry During Invoice Creation**
  - **Problem**: Users couldn't enter line items when creating a detailed invoice - form only showed "Add line items after creating the invoice" message
  - **Root Cause**: Original implementation required invoice to exist in database before line items could be added (needed invoice_id)
  - **User Impact**: Broken workflow forced users to create invoice first, then go back to add line items - poor UX
  - **Solution**: Implemented pre-creation line items system allowing users to add items before invoice creation
    - Created `PreCreationLineItems` component for entering line items during form completion
    - Line items stored in component state (`preCreationLineItems`) until invoice is created
    - After invoice creation, all pre-entered line items are automatically created via API calls
    - Real-time total calculation updates as user adds/edits items

- **üêõ Nested Form Error Fix**
  - **Error**: `<form> cannot contain a nested <form>` - React error causing page reload and data loss
  - **Root Cause**: `PreCreationLineItems` component had a `<form>` element nested inside the main invoice `<form>`
  - **Impact**: Clicking "Add Item" triggered page reload, losing all entered data
  - **Solution**: Replaced nested `<form>` with `<div>` and changed submit button from `type="submit"` to `type="button"` with direct `onClick` handler
  - **Result**: Line items now add smoothly without page reload or data loss

- **üîß Template Usage Tracking Error**
  - **Error**: Console error showing "true" when downloading invoice PDF after creation
  - **Root Cause**: Invalid Supabase query syntax in `updateTemplateUsage` function
    - Used `this.supabase.sql` which doesn't exist in Supabase JS client
    - Caused database error when trying to increment usage_count
    - Error handler returned `{ success: false }` without proper error message
    - Client-side error parsing treated `errorData.error: true` as the error message string
  - **Impact**: Template usage statistics weren't being tracked correctly, console errors appeared
  - **Solution**: Fixed Supabase query to use proper increment pattern
    - Fetch current usage_count first
    - Calculate incremented value: `(template.usage_count || 0) + 1`
    - Update with calculated value
    - Added proper error messages for all failure cases
  - **Result**: Template usage now tracks correctly without console errors
  
- **‚ú® Enhanced Line Items Entry Interface**
  - **Inline Entry Form**: Compact form with Description, Quantity, Unit Price, and calculated Total
  - **Add/Edit/Delete**: Full CRUD operations on line items before invoice creation
  - **Visual Feedback**: Cards displaying each line item with qty √ó price = total breakdown
  - **Empty State**: Helpful empty state with call-to-action to add first item
  - **Validation**: Form validates that detailed invoices have at least one line item before creation
  - **Real-time Updates**: Invoice total updates automatically as line items are added/removed
  - **No Page Reloads**: Smooth interaction without triggering form submission or page navigation
  
- **üéØ Improved User Experience**
  - **Complete Before Submit**: Users can see and edit all invoice details before creating
  - **No Navigation Required**: Single-page workflow without need to navigate back after creation
  - **Visual Confirmation**: Clear display of all line items and totals before submission
  - **Success Message**: Confirmation showing "Invoice created successfully with X line item(s)!"
  - **Warning Indicators**: Amber warning if user tries to create detailed invoice without items
  - **State Preservation**: All form data maintained during line item entry
  - **Clean Console**: No more error messages during PDF generation

### Technical Implementation

- **Component Architecture**:
  - `PreCreationLineItems`: New component handling line items before invoice exists
  - Integrated into `EnhancedInvoiceForm` Detailed tab
  - State management with `preCreationLineItems` array
  - useEffect hooks for real-time total calculation
  - No nested forms - uses div wrapper with button onClick handlers

- **API Integration**:
  - Sequential line item creation after invoice creation
  - Proper sort_order assignment for items
  - Error handling for individual line item failures
  - Graceful degradation if some items fail to create

- **Validation Enhancements**:
  - Required validation: Detailed invoices must have at least one line item
  - Numeric validation for quantity and unit_price
  - Real-time calculation of line totals
  - Form-level validation before submission
  - Client-side validation prevents empty descriptions

### User Workflow Now

1. ‚úÖ User selects "Detailed Line Items" invoice type
2. ‚úÖ Clicks "Add Line Item" button
3. ‚úÖ Fills in Description, Quantity, and Unit Price
4. ‚úÖ Sees calculated line total in real-time
5. ‚úÖ Clicks "Add Item" - item appears in list (no page reload!)
6. ‚úÖ Can edit or delete items before submission
7. ‚úÖ Sees running total update automatically
8. ‚úÖ Clicks "Create Invoice" - invoice and all items created atomically
9. ‚úÖ Receives confirmation with item count

### Business Value

- **Improved Conversion**: Removed friction from detailed invoice creation workflow
- **Professional UX**: Matches user expectations for invoice creation process
- **Data Accuracy**: Users can review all details before submission
- **Time Savings**: Single-step process vs. previous two-step workflow
- **User Confidence**: Visual confirmation of all data before committing to database
- **Zero Data Loss**: No more losing entered data due to page reloads

## [1.9.7] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
#### Database Schema Alignment & Note Type Validation

- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Column Mismatch - `is_private`**
  - **Error**: `Could not find the 'is_private' column of 'client_notes' in the schema cache`
  - **Root Cause**: Client form was sending `is_private` field, but database schema doesn't include this column
  - **Impact**: Unable to create or update notes due to PostgreSQL/Supabase schema validation error
  - **Solution**: Removed `is_private` field from all client-side code
    - Removed from initial `noteForm` state
    - Removed from `handleCreateNote` reset
    - Removed from `handleUpdateNote` reset
    - Removed from `handleEditNote` load
    - Removed from `handleCancelEdit` reset
  - **Files Modified**: `ClientCommunication.js`

- **üìù Note Type Validation Error**
  - **Error**: "Invalid note type" when creating new notes
  - **Root Cause**: Client-side `noteTypes` array didn't match server validation
    - **Client had**: `general`, `meeting`, `call`, `email`, `follow_up`, `important`
    - **Server expects**: `general`, `communication`, `follow_up`, `meeting`, `call`, `email`, `task`, `reminder`
    - **Invalid type**: `important` doesn't exist in database CHECK constraint or server validation
  - **Impact**: Users unable to create new notes, all note creation attempts failed validation
  - **Solution**: Updated `noteTypes` array to match server `NOTE_TYPES` constant
    - Added: `communication` (üí¨ Communication)
    - Added: `task` (‚úÖ Task) 
    - Added: `reminder` (‚è∞ Reminder)
    - Removed: `important` (invalid type)
    - Added `CheckSquare` icon import from lucide-react for task type
  - **Database Schema**: CHECK constraint in `client_notes` table enforces valid note types
  - **Server Validation**: `communicationService.js` validates against `NOTE_TYPES` keys
  - **Result**: All note types now align across client, server, and database layers

- **üîÑ Complete Data Flow Validation**
  - **Client Layer**: Form sends only valid fields that exist in database
  - **Server Layer**: Validates note_type against NOTE_TYPES constant
  - **Database Layer**: CHECK constraint enforces valid enum values
  - **Alignment**: All three layers now perfectly synchronized

## [1.9.6] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
#### Select Component Z-Index & Note Edit/Delete Functionality

- **üéõÔ∏è Dropdown Select Not Working in Dialogs**
  - **Problem**: Type and Priority dropdowns in "Add Note" modal not responding to clicks
  - **Root Cause**: Select component z-index (`z-50`) was below Dialog overlay/content (`z-[101]`)
  - **Solution**: Elevated SelectContent z-index to `z-[150]` in Add Note form
  - **Result**: Dropdowns now appear above modal overlay and are fully clickable
  - **Files Modified**: `ClientCommunication.js` - Both Type and Priority Select components

- **‚úèÔ∏è Edit Note Functionality Implemented**
  - **Problem**: Edit button had no onClick handler, clicking did nothing
  - **Solution**: Added complete edit workflow
    - Added `editingNote` state to track note being edited
    - Implemented `handleEditNote(note)` - Loads note data into form and opens dialog
    - Implemented `handleUpdateNote()` - Sends PUT request to `/api/clients/:id/notes/:noteId`
    - Updated dialog title: "Add New Note" ‚Üî "Edit Note" (dynamic based on mode)
    - Updated submit button text: "Add Note" ‚Üî "Update Note" (dynamic based on mode)
    - Added `handleCancelEdit()` - Clears editing state and resets form
  - **API Endpoint**: `PUT /api/clients/:id/notes/:noteId` (already existed in server)
  - **Result**: Users can now click edit button, modify note details, and save changes

- **üóëÔ∏è Delete Note Functionality Implemented**
  - **Problem**: Delete button had no onClick handler, clicking did nothing
  - **Solution**: Added `handleDeleteNote(noteId)` with confirmation dialog
    - Shows browser confirmation before deletion
    - Sends DELETE request to `/api/clients/:id/notes/:noteId`
    - Refreshes notes list, timeline, and stats after successful deletion
  - **API Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/clients/:id/notes/:noteId` (already existed in server)
  - **Result**: Users can now delete notes with confirmation prompt

- **üîÑ State Management Enhancement**
  - Form now properly handles both create and edit modes
  - Cancel button properly resets state in both modes
  - Dialog closes and refreshes all related data after successful operations
  - Added proper cleanup to prevent state leakage between operations

## [1.9.5] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
#### Client Communication API Integration & UI Component Fixes

- **üéØ Priority Level Validation Error**
  - **Error**: "Invalid priority level" when creating notes or reminders
  - **Root Cause**: Client-server priority value mismatch
    - **Client was sending**: `low`, `medium`, `high`
    - **Server expected**: `low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent`
  - **Impact**: Users unable to create notes or reminders due to validation failure
  - **Solution**: Updated client-side priority values to match server expectations
    - Changed default priority from `medium` to `normal`
    - Updated priorities array: `['low', 'normal', 'high', 'urgent']`
    - Updated initial form states for both notes and reminders
    - Updated form reset states after successful submission
  - **UI Updates**:
    - Low: Green badge
    - Normal: Blue badge (was "Medium" with Yellow)
    - High: Orange badge
    - Urgent: Red badge (new option)

- **üîß Critical API Integration Issues**
  - **Problem**: ClientCommunication component making API calls to Next.js (localhost:3000) instead of Express server (localhost:5000)
  - **Root Cause**: Component using direct `fetch()` calls without proper API base URL configuration
  - **Solution**: Migrated all API calls to use centralized `apiClient` from `@/lib/apiConfig`
  - **Impact**: All communication endpoints now properly route to Express server with JWT authentication
  - **Endpoints Fixed**:
    - `GET /api/clients/:id/notes` - Fetch client notes with filtering
    - `POST /api/clients/:id/notes` - Create new notes
    - `GET /api/clients/:id/timeline` - Activity timeline
    - `GET /api/clients/:id/reminders` - Client reminders
    - `GET /api/clients/:id/communication-stats` - Communication statistics

- **üìä API Response Structure Handling**
  - **Error**: `notes.map is not a function` - Runtime TypeError when navigating to Communications tab
  - **Root Cause**: Incorrect data extraction from API response structure
  - **API Response Formats**:
    - Notes: `{ success: true, data: { notes: [], total, hasMore } }` - Need to access `response.data.notes`
    - Timeline: `{ success: true, data: [] }` - Direct array access `response.data`
    - Reminders: `{ success: true, data: [] }` - Direct array access `response.data`
    - Stats: `{ success: true, data: {} }` - Direct object access `response.data`
  - **Solution**: Updated all fetch functions to correctly extract data based on response structure
  - **Safety Enhancement**: Added `Array.isArray()` check before mapping to prevent runtime errors
  - **Error Handling**: Added fallback empty arrays/objects in catch blocks to maintain UI stability

- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Relationship Error Resolution**
  - **Error**: "Could not find a relationship between 'client_notes' and 'assigned_to'"
  - **Root Cause**: `communicationService.js` attempting to join `assigned_to` column with non-existent relationship
  - **Solution**: Removed invalid join from Supabase query in `getClientNotes()` method
  - **Technical Details**: `assigned_to` column references `auth.users(id)` but Supabase couldn't resolve the relationship
  - **Temporary Fix**: Removed join clause `assigned_user:assigned_to(id, email)` from select query

- **üé® Dropdown Visibility in Modal Dialogs**
  - **Problem**: Select dropdowns (Type, Priority) opening behind modal dialog overlay
  - **Root Cause**: Select component z-index (z-50) lower than Dialog content (z-[101])
  - **Solution**: Elevated Select dropdown z-index to `z-[150]` to appear above all dialogs
  - **Enhanced Styling**:
    - Added explicit background colors: `bg-white dark:bg-slate-800`
    - Added border definition: `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-600`
    - Improved shadow for better depth perception: `shadow-lg`
    - Enhanced hover states: `hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-slate-700`
    - Changed cursor to `pointer` for better UX indication

- **‚å®Ô∏è Tags Input Enhancement**
  - **Problem**: Pressing Enter in tags field was submitting the entire form
  - **Solution**: Added `onKeyDown` handler to prevent form submission on Enter key
  - **Implementation**: `e.preventDefault()` when Enter key is pressed in tags input
  - **User Experience**: Users can now type comma-separated tags without accidentally submitting the form

### Technical Implementation
- **API Client Migration**:
  - Updated `fetchNotes()` to use `apiClient('/api/clients/:id/notes')`
  - Updated `fetchTimeline()` to use `apiClient('/api/clients/:id/timeline')`
  - Updated `fetchReminders()` to use `apiClient('/api/clients/:id/reminders')`
  - Updated `fetchStats()` to use `apiClient('/api/clients/:id/communication-stats')`
  - Updated `handleCreateNote()` to use `apiClient()` with POST method
  - Updated `handleCreateReminder()` to use `apiClient()` with POST method
  - Removed manual `localStorage.getItem('token')` calls (handled by `apiClient`)

- **Component Updates**:
  - Modified `ClientCommunication.js` to import and use `apiClient`
  - Updated all response handling from `response.ok` to `response.success`
  - Changed data access from `data.data` to `response.data`
  - Added proper error handling for all API calls

- **UI Component Enhancements**:
  - Updated `select.jsx` with z-index hierarchy: Dialog (z-[101]) < Select (z-[150])
  - Enhanced SelectContent with explicit color schemes for both light and dark modes
  - Improved SelectItem with better hover states and cursor feedback

### Database Schema Notes
- **Known Issue**: `assigned_to` column in `client_notes` table has relationship issues
- **Workaround**: Removed join clause from queries until relationship is properly configured
- **Future Fix**: Need to either:
  1. Update migration to reference `profiles(id)` instead of `auth.users(id)`, OR
  2. Remove `assigned_to` column if not needed, OR
  3. Configure proper foreign key relationship in Supabase

### User Experience Improvements
- ‚úÖ Notes creation now works correctly with proper API routing
- ‚úÖ Dropdowns are fully visible and clickable within modal dialogs
- ‚úÖ Tags input no longer accidentally submits the form
- ‚úÖ All communication features now properly communicate with server

#### Critical Branding Page Error Resolution - Complete Database Schema Fix
- **üîß Root Cause Analysis & Resolution**
  - **Issue Identified**: "Failed to initialize branding" 500 errors due to database schema mismatch
  - **Problem**: PostgreSQL function `initialize_default_branding` expected columns that didn't exist in actual database
  - **Database Investigation**: Discovered actual schema used different column names (`body_font` vs `primary_font`)
  - **Schema Mismatch**: Migration `015_create_business_branding.sql` was not applied to production database

- **üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Technical Fixes**
  - **Environment Variables**: Fixed server startup issues with dotenv configuration path resolution
  - **Database Connection**: Resolved missing `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment loading

    - Updated response handling from `response.data.success` to `response.success` pattern
    - Enhanced `apiClient` to handle FormData vs JSON content types properly
  - **Service Layer Fix**: Updated `initializeDefaultBranding()` to use actual database column names:
